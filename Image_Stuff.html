  Harry Styles is a man. His name sounds like hairstyles. He has hair. He was once was in a band called No Directions. Just kidding... He was in One Direction. He is British. Which means he is probably on the left spectrum of the political spectrum. Most of Britian is fairly socialist. He is hot. </p>
